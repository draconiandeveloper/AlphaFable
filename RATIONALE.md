## Introduction

It goes without saying, ***it is no one person's job to determine what the people of the future will find of value.***

Many might point out the fact that Artix is still around and many of their games are still available to this day. Although the only guarantee we have is that there will come a time when that will not be the case, nor are we ever so lucky as to be unconditionally gifted the contents of over two decades' worth of efforts.

What we know is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, many stories lost to time and many lessons forgotten. What is certain is that we should take caution when we reminisce; our memories have been manipulated, modified, desecrated by the passage of time and thought.

Rose tinted nostalgia only tells an abridged version of our own story, what is often omitted are the fine details and the "why" behind the myriad of events that led up to where we are now. More than memories were lost in these years, and the importance of keeping these documents around are often ill-appreciated until it is too late to recover. *"You only ever know what all you had when it's gone."*

In somber spirits we seek the comforts of a time when we were blissfully ignorant. Times where our aspirations were only bound by the chains of circumstances by which we had no choice but to tolerate. To seek so ignorant to relive those days of old lends itself to a crucial problem, what you define as the "days of old" only exist now in your memories, there's no returning to whence we came. We must strive to push forward in our lives while only looking back towards these memories from afar; to learn from the mistakes in hopes that we can avoid repeating them.

What rests in this archive is only a snippet of a time, entombed within a sarcophagus of depreciation. Haphazardly modernized with the tools that we have now thanks to many who sought to improve upon the faults of the past. The effectiveness of these efforts are seen through the eyes of whom they behold, many who appreciate the modernity and many who are quick to hold the past high on a pedestal which rests on a foundation of shifting sands.

While there were benefits then that we don't have now, there were also detriments that are often overlooked. **Remember it all for what it truly was, not solely for what you were there to see.**

## 2007 - The Event Horizon

Following a 10 month stint of being torn between two foster homes and numerous psychiatric wards, I would find myself back in the supervision of my family. The shift in priorities that we still feel in the sinues of modern life compounded with the newfound virtues in my life brought about the need for a way to usher in the world of computing and networking in a manner unseen in the eyes of my parents' prior.

The excuse of educational benefits and a sense of relative stability found us in the midst of a local Best Buy holding onto a box with the words "eMachines T3612" printed on its sides. Written on the 120 gigabyte spinning hard drive was an OEM copy of Windows Vista Home Basic, my introduction to the world of computing. The machine, woefully underpowered, demanded a cost of $400 USD at the time of purchase. Two years of warranties appending $200 USD to the advertised price tag, a warranty that was sure to be unmet in no time.

Following in my sister's footsteps, I would create an account on a site that promised social interactivity but delivered a toxic discourse I was fairly familiar with at the time. A site known by the monicker of "MySpace". Without the knowledge of how to block advertisements, I would eventually find myself drawn to an advertisement for an online fantasy roleplaying game called "DragonFable".

A familiarity with the many inadequacies of the eMachines led me to the belief that playing videogames on this computer was comprised of nothing more than the sum of my envy for those who could afford to be so easily and readily entertained. I would still oblige despite these doubts by taking that risky click.

Unbeknownst to my 12 year old self, I would find numerous hours untallied by my memories playing this seemingly simple browser-based Flash game. Ignorant to the long-term effects of an action taken in a mere blink of an eye; ignorant to the ways that these actions would weave the very fabric I still wear on my mind to this day.

I would spend hours of my limited existence playing DragonFable under the supervision of my sister as she would play numerous albums from Linkin Park's Meteora to Disturbed's Believe. Even now as I write this overly-excessive document I listen to my metalcore playlist, a preference that transitioned from the nu metal that I took so kindly to for those many calm moments in an otherwise turbulent life.

Two years would pass with only memories; whose place in this document are decidedly omitted for having no particular importance to this story, before I would find myself taking another risky click...

## 2009 - Opening Pandora's Box

Following the seemingly non-contiguous recommendations from YouTube as I continually binge watched videos, I would stumble across a video tutorial for making a simple Stick RPG trainer in Visual Basic. Newfound intrigue washed over me with no hope of placation, the WYSIWYG design principle that was a stranger to me at the time seemed too good to be true.

A combination of naivety and optimism led me to the download page for a large disc image for Microsoft's Visual Basic 2008. An hour of insurmountable anticipation with an asynchronous DSL network connection pulling bit-by-bit the contents of this ISO file at the rate of 160,000 bytes per second as I felt the ambly fleeting time carve away from its own limited stock.

After a lengthy installation and setup process, I would find myself staring at a blank visage that contained a window encapsulated in another window filled on all sides with icons and text. A quick restart of the tutorial with infrequent pauses would gradually lead me towards building up a duplicate of a simple Flash trainer.

A single empty text box accompanied to its side by a button, nestled beneath a Windows COM component that contained code that abstracted the many intricacies of a Shockwave Flash player. This was my introduction to programming, though I will argue that my efforts at the time don't meet my current expectations when it comes to writing code. I can't argue the fact that this was the entry point to what I continue to do in my spare time today.

The full extent of my amusement of having the power to type almost any number into the textbox prior to a click of the button and have that numerical value reflect itself in the monetary value of the Stick RPG game has long since been forgotten. Though I remember following up this moment with a query on Google to figure out how someone could discover the unseen variables that hide themselves within a Shockwave Flash file.

Through a few sources I would find a recommendation for a proprietary piece of software known as Sothink's SWF Decompiler. Undeterred by the barrier of monetary exchange I would take to Google for another inquiry for an illegit copy of this software. Though it was unlikely to be my first introduction to The Pirate Bay, I can admit with a modicum of shame that it wouldn't be my last time perusing the site.

Another inquiry with Google to find a Bittorrent client would deliver me to a download link for μTorrent. All the pieces were in place to lead me down the winding path towards reverse engineering in hopes of finding more variables to alter with my newfound knowledge of Visual Basic.

## 2013 - Dunning-Kruger's Proposal

A few years passed as I would transition from junior high to high school in 2010, continuing my efforts of making as many programs as I could with Visual Basic. My interests grew into a personality in of itself, an image reflected amongst my high school friend group who would serve many introductions to increasingly complex subject matters in the world of computing.

Through a binge of College Humor videos on YouTube I would stumble across a video that parodied the Matrix with the premise of the "Matrix" being ran on an old Windows XP system. Countless tired punchlines in regards to the instabilities and inadequate performance ended with a mention of something known as "Ubuntu", my introduction to Linux and the world of Free and Open Source Software in 2012.

The following year as a junior in high school would lead to my association with two sophomores who recognized my relatively comprehensive understanding of software design and computer literacy. A seemingly simple proposal was brought to my attention by the sophomores; a fantasy they shared wherein they would follow in the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg and Tom Anderson of owning their own social media website for clout and the unfounded proposition of wealth.

I had familiarity with making simple websites comprised of HTML and CSS, but at the time I had no such familiarity with JavaScript or PHP. Despite being the only person in the triage to know about my inadequacies in backend web design, I would take up the challenge and call upon a freshman from my friend group to assist in the endeavor.

The short-lived efforts of making this delusion into a reality still reside on my external hard drive to this day. The files that used to serve as a sense of unwarranted pride back then now serve as a humbling reminder of where I began.

I'm glad that the dream remained only in our minds, I could only imagine the numerous shenanigans that could have followed had I the persistence to make something that resembled a social media website and the gall to push it onto the Internet at the time. The countless vulnerabilities and the lack of knowing how to maintain and moderate such a project would have caused more anguish than having nothing to show for those short-lived efforts.

## 2016 - Star Struck

Following a couple semesters at a local junior college which saw my introduction to the C language, I would rekindle an old interest in DragonFable by stumbling across a thread on RaGEZONE. The prospect of being able to host my own offline copy of the game with unrestricted access to a database of items and areas that were previously hidden to me by the requirement of a $20 USD "Dragon Amulet" was more than enough to catch my attention.

I would boot up an old installation of UwAmp on my Dell Inspiron 15-3531 laptop and begin to document the steps I took to end up with a semi-functional offline copy of DragonFable. The risky click that I am all too familiar with would show its face yet again in the form of a forum post to a thread belonging to a familiar pseudonym.

Shortly afterwards I would move on to re-playing through the beginning of the game in a similar manner to how I did nearly a decade prior. Defeating the Hydra that once gave me difficulties with the hindsight of knowing to target the two smaller heads early-on as they dealt the most damage.

Shortly after returning to the RaGEZONE thread, I would notice a PM notification and I would follow it to see a message from the creator of the thread that housed my post... MentalBlank, thanking me for writing the post and for updating some of the files in the project to meet my familiarity with PHP at the time.

The paragraph that followed shortly afterwards acknowledged that I was working with files that were estimated to be between 2 to 3 years old followed by the mentioning of MentalBlank's new project at the time.

My introduction to the project titled "AlphaFable".

## 2024 - In Memoriam to Start Anew

Life kept pushing me by, one day at a time. New intrigues quickly overwhelmed old intrigues; new lessons were learned, some in the time-honored tradition of being learned the "hard way".

The memories that I hope can be passed along in this document will eventually fade into a void, either through death or through the hereditary predisposition that goes by the name of Alzheimer's disease that once afflicted my great grandmother in her waning hours by the time she departed at the age of 95 back in 2004. A shaky bridge that I know I will have no other choice but to cross some day given my history with hereditary illnesses.

I'm in a point in my life that bears more resemblance to limbo than anything else that comes to mind, and I keep stumbling across my memories while trying my best to avoid painting them while a pair of rose-tinted shades rest on the bridge of my nose to obstruct my view and washing out the true colors of the past I once called my present.

It's not a painful existence; however, I wouldn't consider it a favorable existence. I hope that I will find something else to occupy my time that will allow me to afford to live again. Until that time comes, I'll have to settle for something to bide my time.

I figure that it's always worthwhile to contribute to something that would otherwise be lost to the sands of time. Not to simply follow every footstep of MentalBlank, HellFireAE, Shinigami, CrisNMP, et al.

*Rather, to pass on my own story while hopefully reminding all of you of a life you once lived.*

***A cheers to more memories, more stories, and more lessons...*** These things that make life worth living when all you have is time to waste with only your memories to accompany you.
